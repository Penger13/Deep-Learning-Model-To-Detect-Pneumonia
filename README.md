# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning  
This project implements a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. The model leverages data augmentation, regularization techniques, and class weights to handle class imbalance and improve generalization performance.  

## Project Overview  
Pneumonia is a significant cause of mortality worldwide, especially in low-resource settings. Accurate and timely diagnosis of pneumonia can improve patient outcomes. This project explores the potential of deep learning to automate the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of **5,856 chest X-ray images**, split into:  
- **Normal cases**: 1,583 images  
- **Pneumonia cases**: 4,273 images  

The data was preprocessed and augmented using the following techniques:  
- Random flipping  
- Rotation  
- Zooming  
- Contrast adjustment  
- Brightness adjustment  
- Gaussian noise  

## Model Architecture  
The CNN architecture includes:  
- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from images.  
- **Pooling Layers**: For downsampling feature maps.  
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.  
- **Dropout**: To prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.  
- **L2 Regularization**: To encourage smaller and more generalizable weights.  

## Training Techniques  
### Data Augmentation  
Augmentation techniques were applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness.  

### Class Weighting  
Class weights were introduced to handle the class imbalance in the dataset. The weight for the minority class (Normal) was increased during training to improve classification performance.  

### Loss Function  
The model was trained using **categorical cross-entropy loss**, optimized with the **Adam optimizer**.  

## Model Performance  
The model was evaluated on a held-out test set of **624 images**, achieving the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy**: 89.1%  
- **Precision (Normal)**: 0.89  
- **Precision (Pneumonia)**: 0.89  
- **Recall (Normal)**: 0.81  
- **Recall (Pneumonia)**: 0.94  
- **F1-Score (Normal)**: 0.85  
- **F1-Score (Pneumonia)**: 0.91  

Confusion Matrix:  
|               | Predicted Normal | Predicted Pneumonia |  
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|  
| **Actual Normal**   | 189                | 45                  |  
| **Actual Pneumonia** | 24                 | 366                 |  

## Results  
- **Regularization Impact**: Incorporating dropout and L2 regularization improved model performance, reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization.  
- **Class Weights**: The use of class weights led to significant improvements in detecting the minority class (Normal).  
- **Visualization**: Test predictions were visualized to qualitatively evaluate the model's performance.
